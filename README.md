# NavWalkAssist(N.W.A)
PennApps XIX Project

NavWalkAssist(N.W.A) is the white cane improved. This project uses a Arduino, a ultrasonic sensor, and a speaker. A normal white cane can only notify the user that they bumped into an object only after the stick collides with it. But N.W.A warns the user using a series of beeps before they collide with an obstacle.
